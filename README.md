# EurOPDX-Galaxy
This repository contains recipe for docker version of [Galaxy platform](www.galaxyproject.org), expanded with tools and workflows for PDX(Patient Derived Xenograft) model molecular data analysis.
In all cases, for the use of this docker image, you need to have [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) installed. If you do not wish to build the image yourself, which is unnecessary unless you need to change something radical in the image, then you only need to download the [docker-compose.yml]() file and set the correct paths in the "volumes:".
